# Step 1: Start from an official ROS 2 Jazzy desktop-full image
FROM osrf/ros:jazzy-desktop-full

# install ros2 packages

    
# Alternatively, ros:jazzy-perception might be sufficient if you don't need full desktop tools
# but osrf/ros:jazzy-desktop-full is more comprehensive for GUIs.

# Set the default shell to bash for all subsequent RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT commands
SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-c"]

# Step 2: Set environment variables
# DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive prevents interactive prompts during apt-get installs.
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
# Set ROS_DISTRO, though it's usually inherited from the base image, explicitly setting it can be safer.
ENV ROS_DISTRO=jazzy
# Set HUSARION_ROS_BUILD_TYPE, so it's available globally for all subsequent RUN commands and at runtime.
ENV HUSARION_ROS_BUILD_TYPE=simulation

# Step 3: Install necessary system dependencies and tools
# Many GUI libraries will be included in desktop-full.
# python3-vcstool is needed for the 'vcs import' command.
RUN sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y \
    git \
    git-lfs \
    python3-colcon-common-extensions \
    python3-rosdep \
    python3-vcstool \
    # Add other specific dependencies for husarion_ugv_ros if known,
    # especially if they are GUI related and not covered by desktop-full.
    # For example, specific Qt libraries or other graphics libraries.
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Step 4: Create a ROS 2 workspace
WORKDIR /
RUN sudo mkdir /husarion_ws
RUN git lfs clone -b main https://github.com/NSpaceTeam/husarion_ws_helper.git /husarion_ws


# Step 6: Initialize rosdep, import dependencies, install dependencies, and build the workspace
# This combines multiple steps into a single RUN command to ensure correct environment variable
# scoping and to reduce Docker image layers.
WORKDIR /husarion_ws

RUN sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

RUN rm /etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d/20-default.list  
RUN sudo rosdep init
RUN rosdep update --rosdistro $ROS_DISTRO
RUN rosdep install --from-paths src -y -i
RUN echo "source /opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
RUN . /opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/setup.bash && echo $MY_VARIABLE && colcon build --symlink-install --packages-up-to husarion_ugv --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF
RUN echo "source /husarion_ws/install/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
RUN . /husarion_ws/install/setup.bash && echo $MY_VARIABLE
SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-c"]
RUN echo "source /husarion_ws/install/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc

# Step 7: Set up the entrypoint to source ROS 2 and the workspace
# Ensure entrypoint.sh is present in the same directory as the Dockerfile (the build context).
COPY ./entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
RUN chmod +x /entrypoint.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-c"]
# Step 7: Set up the entrypoint to source ROS 2 and the workspace
# Ensure entrypoint.sh is present in the same directory as the Dockerfile (the build context).
COPY ./entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
RUN chmod +x /entrypoint.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]

# Step 8: Default command
# This provides an interactive bash shell when the container starts without a command.
CMD ["bash"]
